        <p>
        When I was in high school I discovered fractals.
        I read Benoit Mandelbrot's biography and started designing my own.
        I used this one to sign my surfboard repairs, helmet, and other projects.
        In the past I used to create it by hand using a compass and ruler, but that was way too time intensive.
        This is its first digital incarnation.
