<h2>June Update</h2>

<p>
It's been a rough few months.
The world is getting turned upside down, for better or for worse, and yet life goes on.
</p>
<p>
I planted my trees two months ago.
Four of the acorns sprouted and I transplanted all of them.
Since then one has died.
This was the first to sprout and the biggest when it croaked.
</p>
<p>
The biggest surprise, however, was the smallest and last tree I planted.
In the first few days a ground squirrel burrowed up underneath it.
Then, if that wasn't enough, something clipped off its leaves, leaving a barren stem.
I thought this one was a lost cause.
Yet, in a heroic comeback, this last week it has 9 new leaves!
