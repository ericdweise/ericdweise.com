<h1>My Logo</h1>
<p>
When I was in high school I discovered fractals.
I read Benoit Mandelbrot's biography and started designing my own.
I used this one to sign my surfboard repairs, helmet, and other projects.
In the past I used to create it by hand using a compass and ruler, but that was way too time intensive.
This is its first digital incarnation.
