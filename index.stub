        This site is a partial collection of my thoughts and work, and is an attempt to be the center of my digital presence.

        If you're here to learn about me here are the basics.
        I enjoy being outdoors and my favorite things to do are biking, backpacking, and surfing.
        I have a mild obsession with the TV show Firefly, and I have a dog named <a href="bernie.html">Bernie</a>.
        Wherever I live I need to have a garden, whether it's a full yard or just a few small planters on a patio.

        I am always <i>doing things the hard way</i>.
        I learn best by jumping in to a project head first and getting my hands dirty.
        This has an added effect that I am more familiar with what I build when I am done.
        I'm constantly online figuring out how to fix my car or repair a surfboard.
        To me, the process is as important as the product, and how something is done is as important as finishing it.

        I believe that the energy you bring to a room, relationship, or company will circle back to you.
        Everyone around you breathes the same air, and happiness, confidence, grit, and despair are all contagious.

        My closest friends are people who find their own, unique way of doing things.
        They don't usually find the easiest, most straight forward way, but they have interesting stories and are the best teachers.
        In turn, I hope to teach the people around me all the interesting things I have learned.
