        This page was inspired when I listened to Derek Sivers's interview with Tim Ferriss 
        <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/">(interview number 125)</a>.
        I thought this is not only a great tell people what I'm working on but also to remind myself what's important.
        So, I am joining the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">NowNowNow</a> movement.
        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Persuing a master's in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Applied Physics at UC San Diego.
            <li> Training for a triathalon. I haven't signed up for one yet, but I have told myself I will complete one by the end of the 2020! I will put up a page to track my progress soon.
            <li> Working with the Jacobs Graduate Student Council as the <em>Industry and Entrepreneurial Chair</em>.
                Currently my goals are to increase student engagement with industry, particularly with startups, and securing funding for JGSC to continue operating next year.
            <li> Starting a software development consulting business.
                See my <a href="/consulting/">Consulting</a> page for more information!
            <li> Being more grounded in nature.
                I haven't been backpacking in over a year and I feel like I'm starting to forget what it is like to be wholly imersed in wilderness.
                I'm tentatively planning 3 backpacking trips in the next few months.
                Check out my <a href="/adventures/">adventures</a> as I write about them!
        </ul>
        <h2>What I'm reading</h2>
