        I started my career as a Software Developer at a small startup company right after I graduated from university in 2015.
        Originally I was hired as an algorithm developer, but as our our customer base grew my responsibilities expanded beyond writing code.
        For the last several years my job has been to ensure the integrity of our products and the continuity of our services to customers.
        If your project or company needs help in any of these areas please contact me at EricDWeise @ gmail.com.

        Development Operations (DevOps) is the art of getting high quality software to users as quickly as possible.
        I can help you take your idea and turn it into a secure, stable, and scalable package.
        With a proper orchestration I will minimize your software development lifecycle.
        Whether you have tens of customers or millions they all deserve to have your .

        <p>
