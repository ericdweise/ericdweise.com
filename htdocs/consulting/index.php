        <p>
        I started my career as a Software Developer at a small startup company right after I graduated from university in 2015.
        Originally I was hired as an algorithm developer, but as our customer base grew my responsibilities expanded beyond writing code.
        For the last several years my job was to ensure the integrity of our products and the continuity of our services.
        I take great joy in writing and deploying useful code, and I can help you by applying my experience to your software project.
        Whether you're in the early stages of bootstrapping your idea
        or you need an extra developer to push a project out the door I can help.
        If you are interested in hiring me please contact me at ericdweise [gmail].

        <h1>Services</h1>
        <h2>DevOps</h2>
        <p>
        Building your software project is just the first step.
        Once your code is working how do you get your code to your customers?
        </p>
        Development Operations (DevOps) is the art of getting high quality software to users as quickly as possible.
        I can help you take your idea and turn it into a secure, stable, and scalable package.
        With a proper orchestration I will minimize your software development lifecycle.
        Whether you have tens of customers or millions they all deserve to have your latest and greatest product.
        To control your workflow I can:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li> Implement CI/CD so that your customers are always running the most recent, stable version of your product.
        <li> Automate unit tests to ensure that an errant commit doesn't bring down your operation.
        <li> Start GitFlow so that your team is working from the same code base.
        <li> Develop moitoring services so that you can understand how and when your product is being used.
        <li> Automate alert systems so that your teams know when any critical events happen.
        </ul>
        <h2>Cloud Deployment</h2>
        <p>
        There are many reasons you might consider moving to the cloud: from lower computing costs to scalability.
        I have used the major cloud providors extensively and I can help you move your infrastructure out of your IT closet.
        I can help you:
        <ul>
        <li> Rewrite your code to take advantage of <em>serverless architecture</em>.
        <li> Orchestrate containers to compartmentalize your product operations.
        <li> Take advantage of deployment zones to target different geographic markets.
        </ul>
        <h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>
        <p>
        Production software hardly ever exists outside a regulated environment.
        I was the lead developer for a healthcare software package so I am familiar working within the bounds of FDA regulation.
        If your product needs to conform to a strict regulatory criteria or requires documentation I can help:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li> Write software Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA).
        <li> Apply Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA).
        <li> Prepare documentation for the FDA or other regulatory bodies.
        </ul>
