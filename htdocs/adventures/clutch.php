<h1>A Housebound Adventure</h1>
<p>
I have a 2008 Subaru Impreza.
This car and I have been through thick and thin together.
We have a fond history, but, the years are starting to take their toll.
I always take care of her -- regular fluid changes, maintenance, and washes -- but entropy is relentless.
Last March, just as shelter in place was being rolled out, my clutch stopped working.
I was at the tail end of a 600 mile road trip up the coast and in literally the last mile I discovered I couldn't shift gears.
While I was happy I didn't get stuck in the middle of Los Angeles, serious car trouble was not something I wanted to deal with.
</p>
<p>
I knew enough about cars to make them go forwards and keep them from moving too far sideways, but I was out of my league with this problem.
However, being a resourceful millenial, I turned to Google.
After an hour searching for terms like "I can't shift when engine is on" I had narrowed my problem down to four possible sources:
<ul>
  <li> a depleted clutch fluid,
  <li> a busted master and/or slave cylinders,
  <li> a broken clutch diaphram, or
  <li> a trashed throwout bearing.
</ul>
(In the end it turned out it wasn't any of those things.)

My parents raised me to be fiercly independent, (sometimes to a fault.)
