            <h1>My Compadre</h1>
            <p>
            Meet my hiking buddy, Bernie, who's been following me around since February 2017.
            At the time I was fostering dogs through <a href="https://www.labsandmore.org/">Labs and More</a> in San Diego.
            Bernie was a stray dog from Tijuana, and he came to us with a form of transmissible cancer called TVT.
            He stayed with me while he was being treated, a process that took eight months and included two rounds of chemotherapy and three courses of radiation therapy.
            After he was cured I decided that he was going to stay with me indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
            No matter what life throws at Bernie he is the happiest dog.
            He loves dirty socks, belly rubs, and occasionally eating out of the trash.
            </p>
            <h2>Is Bernie politically active?</h2>
            <p>
            People ask me a lot if Bernie was named after a certain member of Congress.
            I usually explain that he does have some common ground with the famous Senator:
            They have the same hairstyle!
            However, Bernie, like me, finds the incessant bickering in politics to be overwhelming, and so he has no aspirations for higher office.
            </p>
<h2>Bernie and Friends</h2>

Bernie can make friends with anyone,

but sometimes he's not that approachable.
</p>
<h2>Epilepsy</h2>
<p>
In the summer of 2019 Bernie started having seizures.
They are now a somewhat regular part of our lives, but we're managing it with medication and CBD oil.
We're monitoring these with my cousin, who is a veterinarian.
Hopefully they stay benign.
