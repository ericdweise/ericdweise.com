            <h1>My Compadre</h1>
            <p>Meet my hiking buddy, Bernie. He entered my life in February 2017. At the time I was fostering dogs through <a href="">Labs and More</a> in San Diego. He was brought up from the streets of Tijuana. He had a form of transmissible cancer calle TVT that maniested as a bloody tumor. After eight months of treatment, which included two rounds of chemotherapy and three courses of radiation therapy he was cured. </p>
            <p>Despite all his problems, Bernie is the happiest dog I have ever had, and he is a great hiker. He loves dirty socks, belly rubs, eating chicken out of the trash.</p>
            <h2>Is Bernie pollitically active?</h2>
            <p>When I first met Bernie he already shared a name with a certain member of Congress. But the name fits his personality and so it stuck.</p>
