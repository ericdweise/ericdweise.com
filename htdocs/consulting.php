        <h1>Software Development and DevOps Consulting</h1>
        <p>I have spent the past several years as the Lead Software Developer at a small startup company. I learned how to work in a small company to support research teams by providing operational support and preparing healthcare software for the regulated production environment. If your company needs help in these areas please contact me at EricDWeise[snail]gmail.com.</p>
