        <h1>Software Development and DevOps Consulting</h1>
        <p>I started my career as a Software Developer at a small startup company right after I graduated from university in 2015. Originally I was hired as an algorithm developer, but as our product and my codebase grew I began working more and more packaging and deploying our product to customers. For the last several years my responsibilities have been to to ensure the integrity of our products and the continuity of our services to customers.</p>

        <h2>Specialties</h2>
        <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
        <p>Production code hardly ever exists outside a regulated environment. Having written code for a healthcare software package I am familiar working within the bounds of FDA regulation. This includes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing production level code
            <li>Writing unit tests in accordance with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
            <li>Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA)
            <li>Preparing documentation for FDA applications
        </ul>
        <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
        <p>I have deployed products to Amazon Web Services and have used it extensively in my profesional and personal work. Besides AWS I have also used GoogleCloud and Digital Ocean. Through these experiences I have learned and can help you with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda)
            <li>Leveraging and swarming containers (Docker)
            <li>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
        </ul>
        <h3>Development Methods</h3>
        <p>My previous projects have been with small, integrated teams. This has required me and my co-workers to wear many hats and work in close support of one another. The easiest way I have found to do this is by setting up a rigorous development environment. I use the following organizational tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile development (in the form of Agility)
            <li>Source Control using Git and Git Flow
            <li>Test driven development
            <li>Peer reviewed code
        </ul>
