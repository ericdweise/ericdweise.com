        <h1>Software Development and DevOps Consulting</h1>
        <p>
        I started my career as a Software Developer at a small startup company right after I graduated from university in 2015.
        Originally I was hired as an algorithm developer, but as our product and my codebase grew my responsibility to package and deploy our product to customers took priority.
        For the last several years my job has been to ensure the integrity of our products and the continuity of our services to customers.

        <h2>Specialties</h2>
        <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
        <p>
        Production code hardly ever exists outside a regulated environment.
        I was the lead developer for a healthcare software package, so I am familiar working within the bounds of FDA regulation.
        If your product needs to conform to a strict regulatory criteria I can help, particularly in the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing production level code
            <li>Writing unit tests and building your Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
            <li>Applying Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA)
            <li>Preparing documentation for FDA applications
        </ul>
        <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
        <p>
        I have deployed products to Amazon Web Services and have used it extensively in my professional and personal work.
        In addition to AWS I have also used GoogleCloud and Digital Ocean.
        Through these experiences I have learned and can help you with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda)
            <li>Leveraging and swarming containers (Docker)
            <li>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
        </ul>
        <h3>Development Methods</h3>
        <p>
        My previous projects have been with small, integrated teams.
        This has required my co-workers and me to wear many hats and work in close support of one another.
        The easiest way I have found to do this is by setting up a rigorous development environment.
        I use the following organizational tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile development (in the form of <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html">Agility</a>)
            <li>Source Control using Git and Git Flow
            <li>Test driven development
            <li>Peer reviewed code
        </ul>
        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
