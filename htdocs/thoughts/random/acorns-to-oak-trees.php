        People often compare to boring things to "watching the grass grow."
        I think that people who say this don't spend enough time gardening.
        Last fall I grabbed a handful of acorns while hiking in the San Diego mountains and potted them.
        Just last week they started sprouting and it is really exciting to see these little guys get going!
        When they get big enough I'm going to plant them in the open space near my condo.
