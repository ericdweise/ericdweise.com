This page was inspired when I listened to Derek Sivers's interview with Tim Ferriss 
<a href="https://tim.blog/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/">(interview number 125)</a>.
I thought this is not only a great way to tell people what I'm working on but also to remind myself what's important.
So, I am joining the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">NowNowNow</a> movement.
<h2>Where I Call Home</h2>
Boulder, CO
<h2>What I'm working on</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Studying for my Offensive Security Certified Professional exam.
    <li> Studying for the Patent Bar.
        Unlike other Bar exams the Patent Bar is valid nationwide and a law degree is not a prerequisite.
        Once I pass the exam I will become a Patent Agent, an engineer who can file patents with the USPTO.
    <li> Self studying encryption protocols.
        I want to learn how we keep comunications on the internet safe.
        Not just by erading about them, but I want to build my own implementations of the protocols.
        Follow my prgress on <a href="https://github.com/ericdweise/crypto">GitHub</a>
    <li> Training for my first marathon and triathlon.
</ul>
<h2>What I'm reading</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <em>On the Shortness of Life</em> by Seneca
    <li> <em>High Output Management</em> by Andy Grove
    <li> <em>The Four Hour Work Week</em> by Tim Ferriss
</ul>
<h2>What I'm Listening To</h2>
<p>
Normally when I'm in a <em>get stuff done</em> mood I turn to fast, distorted music like
<a href="https://youtu.be/sAsMUXuBeB8?t=20">Angel Vivaldi</a>.
I feel like fast cadence channels into fast work.
Recently, however, I've been listening to slower music.
I find that it gives me a lot of focused and sustained energy.
Two playlists that I've been playing pretty much nonstop are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY3cAFsquIk7VGMuk-V8S3g/featured">Meute</a> and 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rpoland">Candyrat Records</a>.
