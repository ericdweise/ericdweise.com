        Including open source software in your commercial project is not a decision that can be taken lightly.
        An improper inclusion can prevent you from making any profits, and might even require you to release your entire software base to the public.
        I have worked with Open Source projects for a long time and I can help you navigate the confusing landscape of Open Source Licenses.

        I am also studying to be a registered Patent Agent with the USPTO.
        Soon I will be able to write and submit pattents in the United States.
