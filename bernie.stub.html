    <h1>My Compadre</h1>
    <p>
    Meet my hiking buddy, Bernie, who's been following me around since February 2017.
    At the time I was fostering dogs through <a href="https://www.labsandmore.org/">Labs and More</a> in San Diego.
    Bernie was a stray dog from Tijuana, and he came to us with a form of transmissible cancer called TVT.
    He stayed with me while he was being treated, a process that took eight months and included two rounds of chemotherapy and three courses of radiation therapy.
    After he was cured I decided that he was going to stay with me indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
    No matter what life throws at Bernie he is the happiest dog.
    He loves dirty socks, belly rubs, and occasionally eating out of the trash.
    </p>
    <h2>Is Bernie politically active?</h2>
    <p>
    People ask me a lot if Bernie was named after a certain member of Congress.
    I usually explain that he does have some common ground with the famous Senator:
    They have the same hairstyle!
    However, Bernie, like me, finds the incessant bickering in politics to be overwhelming, and so he has no aspirations for higher office.
    </p>

<p>Bernie can make friends with anyone.</p>
<h2>Epilepsy</h2>
<p>
In the summer of 2019 Bernie started having seizures.
They are now a somewhat regular part of our lives, but we're managing it with medication and CBD oil.
We're monitoring these with my cousin, who is a veterinarian.
Hopefully they stay benign.
